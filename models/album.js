EDIT / Delete

Melchizedek is an artist who was jsut signed to Tune.ly.  he wants to check out
their website to see what other types of artists they represent. 

After looking through the page, he notices one of the songs on his album info is spelled wrong .  he clicks on the edit button on the album card and is taken to a new page with a form to edit the detials.

He corrects the spelling and clicks update, and sees the song correctly displayed on the details above.

Then he notices that he wants to change the genre of his album to 
"post-punk electronic folk", so he edits that too.

everything is instantly updated on the page for him to see.

then he follows the link to the main page, where he can see everything else.

Scrolling down to the bottom, Melchizedek realizes theres a double of their most famous album "candid candidates".  He follows the edit link to the edit page, and deletes the duplicate.
